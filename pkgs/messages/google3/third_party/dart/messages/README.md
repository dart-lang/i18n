A lightweight modular library for localization (l10n) functionality.

## Goals

To enable localization which supports

 - Localized file update without recompile,
 - Easy and safe use through named method and argument generation,
 - Small file size, treeshaking both unused locales and unused messages.

## Status - experimental

 - Serialize to binary: -
 - Serialize to JSON: :heavy_check_mark:
 - Deserialize JSON: :heavy_check_mark:
 - Deserialize JSON using browser JS: -
 - Deserialize binary: -
 - Tree shake message files: -

## Partitioning

The package is partitioned to allow a package to consume some parts of the library only as a `dev_dependency`, not including the message building and serialization packages in the dependencies for the application.

### `messages`
Contains the interface for a `MessageList` and the different subtypes of `Message`s as well as the functionality to parse a data file into a `MessageList`.
### `messages_builder`
The `builder` to generate the named methods and data files from the input `arb` translation files. Has a dependency on `messages_serializer` and `messages`.

### `messages_serializer`
The logic for serializing `arb` message files into data files.

## Example
Add `package:messages` to your dependencies:
```bash
dart pub add messages
```

Given translation message files in two languages:
`en.arb`
This reference file is written by the developer.
```json
{
    "@@locale":"en",
    "@@context": "AboutPage",
    "aboutMessage": "About {website}",
    "@aboutMessage": {
        "placeholders": {
            "website" : {
                "type":"string"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
and `fr.arb`
This translated file was created by a translator given the reference `en.arb`.
```json
{
    "@@locale":"fr",
    "@@context": "AboutPage",
    "aboutMessage": "À propos de {website}",
}
```
you can then run

`dart run messages`

This will generate both code to call your messages, as well as data files which will be shipped with your application. You can then use these generated files by importing the generated files:

```dart
import 'dart:io';

import 'package:example/aboutpage_arb_file.g.dart'; // <-- This was generated right now
import 'package:messages/messages_native.dart';
import 'package:messages/package_intl_object.dart';

void main() {
  final aboutPageMessages = AboutPageMessages(
    (String id) => File('lib/$id').readAsBytesSync(),
    OldIntlObject(),
  );
  aboutPageMessages.loadLocale('fr');
  print(aboutPageMessages.aboutMessage(website: 'mywebsite.com')); // 'À propos de mywebsite.com'
  aboutPageMessages.loadLocale('en');
  print(aboutPageMessages.aboutMessage(website: 'mywebsite.com')); // 'About mywebsite.com'
}
```

Optionally, add options to your `pubspec.yaml` by specifying any of these keys:
```yaml
package_options:
  messages_builder:
    generateMethods: true # whether to generate named methods
    generateFindById: false # whether to allow messages to be retrieved by ID
    generateFindBy: integer # {none, integer, enumerate}, the type of key to use
    header: | # the custom header message. Will always be prefixed by // in the generated code.
      Generated by flutter_messages.

      // Some custom
      // multi
      // line
      // header
```
