# Dart Style Guide

This style guide outlines the coding conventions for contributions to the
`dart-lang/**` repositories.

## Best Practices

- Follow [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
- Code should be tested.
- Write code follow the guidance described in [effective Dart](https://dart.dev/effective-dart).

## General Philosophy

- Optimize for readability - code is read more often than it is written.

## Documentation

- At least all public members should have documentation, answering the *why*.
- Assume the reader does not know everything. Link to definitions.
- Provide sample code.
